# Adapt [Work in progress]
Adapt will become a (mobile) app that you can use to create your own productivity apps. Lots of apps already exist that allow you to track macros, take down notes or manage habits. However, most of them - if not all - have functionality blocks. Ever come across an app that seemed perfect for you, only to realise one tiny thing you want to do is not possible? Or maybe your favourite feature being part of a premium subscription? Adapt aims to solve these problems by allowing users to write their own apps using an intuitive interface, right from the comfort of their phones.
